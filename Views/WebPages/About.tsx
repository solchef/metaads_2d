      <h5 className="pb-2 text-primary"><i>ABOUT US</i> </h5>
      <p>
        We created the Meta-Board, the online version of your traditional
        billboard.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.TheMillionDollarWebsite.com">
          The Million Dollar Website

          www.quadspace.io
        </a>
        .Because Quadspace powers the Metaverse component of this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each pixel on the Meta-Board will also come with 1 parcel of land in the
        Quadspace metaverse as a BONUS!
      </p>

        What’s so special about The Million Dollar Website?{' '}
      </h5>
      <p>
        This is your chance to truly own for the first time a piece of digital
        history through blockchain technology. We divided the MetaBoard to 1
        million pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each pixel you own tied to the ownership or holder of the TMDW nft will
        grant you access to any image, input a URL domain and even name the
        specific pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we are building towards a fully decentralized system everything in
        uncensored we are for the liberty of the people. You can post about
        yourself, your business, a crypto project, you’re nft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anything you like! Through the partnership with Quadspace each pixel
        will come with its own meta land. Here you can get creative and design
        anything you like.
      </p>
      <p>
        So that when people click on your pixel it gives them the option to jump
        into your meta space!
      </p>

          The Million Dollar Website

        acted as an advertising board on the internet, selling one million
        pixels on the web for $1 each.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back then the web was still very static and there were no digital native
        forms of transacting value so when pixels were bought and set, they
        could no longer be re-sold or updated.

        TMDW infuses these modern innovations into the original idea to build a
        much more fun and functional virtual space to share content on anything
        you like!{' '}
      </p>

      <h4 className="pb-2 mt-4"> How does it work? </h4>
      <p>
        TMDW has 1,000,000 blocks on a 1000 x 1000 2D grid represented by
        1,000,000 NFTs on the Ethereum network. Each NFT can either be minted or
        bought second-hand from someone who's already minted it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once owned, you can put any image within that block, along with a title,
        description and url to another website! To mint new blocks and make use
        of Ethereum and Web3 technologies you need to have a Web3 enabled plugin
        like{' '}
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://metamask.io">
          Metamask
        </a>{' '}

        your wallet.

        You'll need{' '}

        of the network. Simply select "mint" in the side-panel for a block
        that's not yet been minted and confirm the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you own the NFT that represents a block you can then change the
        image, title, description and url by clicking it and selecting "update
        token" on the side-panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        By connecting your wallet the site will recognize that you own that NFT
        and allow you to update the content associated with that block.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it's a simple as that, buy blocks as NFTs then share your NFTs,
        projects and creations in this digital content space with the entire
        world!
