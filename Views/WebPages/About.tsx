          We created the Meta-Board the online version of your traditional billboard. www.TheMillionDollarWebsite.com (http://www.themilliondollarwebsite.com/) leads to the domain www.quadspace.io (http://www.quadspace.io/). Because Quadspace powers the Metaverse component of this project. Each pixel on the Meta-Board will also come with 1 parcel of land in the Quadspace metaverse as a BONUS!

          <h4 className="pb-2"> What’s so special about The Million Dollar Website? </h4>
          This is your chance to truly own for the first time a piece of digital history through blockchain technology. We divided the MetaBoard to 1 million pixels. Each pixel you own tied to the ownership or holder of the TMDW nft will grant you access to upload upload any image, input a URL domain and even name the specific pixels. Since we are building towards a fully decentralized system everything in uncensored we are for the liberty of the people. You can post about yourself, your business, a crypto project, you’re nft. Anything you like! Through the partnership with Quadspace each pixel will come with it’s own meta land. Here you can get creative and design anything you like. So that when people click on your pixel it gives them the option to jump into your meta space!

          When it was created in 2005, milliondollarhomepage.com <br /> (http://milliondollarhomepage.com/)  <br />
          acted as an advertising board on the internet, selling one million pixels on the web for $1 each.
           Back then the web was still very static and there were no digital native forms of transacting value
            so when pixels were bought and set, they could no longer be re-sold or updated.
          Today the internet is a lot more fun to play with and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
          <br />   (https://bitcoin.org/en/faq)  <br />and Ethereum  <br />(https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) <br /> have ushered in a whole new age known as Web3  <br />(https://ethereum.org/en/developers <br />/docs/web2-vs-web3/) <br /> where digitally native money and assets, represented by tokens  <br />
          (https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ethereum-tokens-fbd5611fe30b) <br /> and NFTs  <br />(https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/), <br /> can be transacted openly peer-to-peer  <br />(https://www.investopedia.com/terms<br />/p/peertopeer-p2p-service.asp) <br /> across the internet. TMDW infuses these modern innovations into the original idea to build a much more fun and functional virtual space to share content on anything you like!       </p>
      </div>
      <div className="d-flex">
        <p>
          <h4 className="pb-2"> How does it work? </h4> TMDW has 1,000,000 blocks on a 1000 x 1000 2D grid represented by 1,000,000 NFTs on the Ethereum network. Each NFT can either be minted or bought second-hand from someone who's already minted it. Once owned, you can put any image within that block, along with a title, description and url to another website!
          To mint new blocks and make use of Ethereum and Web3 technologies you need to have a Web3 enabled plugin like Metamask (https://metamask.io/) or browser like Brave (https://brave.com/), which has a native crypto wallet, and to have some cryptocurrency in your wallet. You'll need Ether (https://ethereum.org/en/eth/) in your wallet to pay for the minting fees (https://postergrind.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-mint-an-nft/) of the NFT collection and mining fees (https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-101/ethereum-mining-works) of the network. Simply select "mint" in the side-panel for a block that's not yet been minted and confirm the transaction.
          Once you own the NFT that represents a block you can then change the image, title, description and url by clicking it and selecting "update token" on the side-panel. By connecting your wallet the site will recognizes that you own that NFT and allow you to update the content associated with that block.
          And its a simple as that, buy blocks as NFTs then share your NFTs, projects and creations in this digital content space with the entire world!
